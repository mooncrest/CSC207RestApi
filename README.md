# CSC207RestApi
A RestApi developed for an android game developed in CSC207

Documentation for rest api for requests will be added soon

# First attempt:
Currently using a json file stored locally in LeaderBoards.json and Users.json. A few random tests with sample data is currently within it but plans to implement a mongoDB database and will replace the current one with a dependency injection. Currently uses a implementation of a token system but will eventually implement a system like OAuth 2.0.
