# CSC207RestApi
A RestApi developed for an android game developed in CSC207

# First attempt:
Currently using a json file stored locally in LeaderBoards.json and Users.json. A few random tests with sample data is currently within it but plans to implement a mongoDB database and will replace the current one with a dependency injection.
